# data-analytics-prototypes

### Overview

Prototypes / Code Samples for Data Analytics concepts and code libraries.  The following languages are explored in this 
repository:

> Python - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib libraries are among the most popular in data analytics.

> C - Many data analytics libraries use C at a lower-level or are based on C concepts.

> Fortran - Fortran still has a niche audience in the data analytics world.

> LLVM - LLVM is used by some data analytic libraries to compile higher-level code to machine code.

> R - R is the best option if you need a domain-specific language for data analytics.
